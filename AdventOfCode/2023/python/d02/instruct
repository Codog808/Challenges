Figure out the number of cubes of red, green, or blue in a bag from the Elf's game.
- ID is Game number
- each set of cubes revealed are separated by semi-colons for each game.

< PART 1 >
* add up the IDs of the games to get your soution.
* find which bag is loaded with only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes.
	- if the bag has more than either number of the desired cube count it is invalid

< PART 2 >
* find the minimum cubes required to play the game.
* multiply the minimum number of cubes together to obtain the POWER.
# add all the POWERS of the games together for solution
