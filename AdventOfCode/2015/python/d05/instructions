# Part 1
find which strings in a file are naughty or nice.

Nice:
	contains at least three vowels, {aeiou}
	contains one letter that appears twice in a row
	does not contain ab, cd, pq, xy
opposite of nice is naughty, lol.

How many strings are nice?

#Part 2

Nice:
- it contains a pair of any two letters that appears at least tiwce in the string without overlapping. Like 'xyxy' or 'aabaa'
- It contains at least one letter which repeats with exactly one letter between them, like 'xyx', 
abcdefe' (efe), or 'aaa'
