PART 1
a wire has an identifier,(some of which are lowercase), and carries a 16-bit signal (0 to 65535)
a signal is provided by a gate, another wire, or specifically defined.
a wire can only get information from one source and can provide the signal to multiple destinations
a gate provides no signal until the inputs have a signal.

instructions provide how ot connect the parts together, x AND y -> z
	connect x and y to an AND gate and connect the gate's output to z.
123 -> x
	signal 123 provided to 'wire x'
p LSHIFT 2 -> q 
	means that the value from the 'wire p' is left-shifted by 2
NOT e -> bitwise 
	complement of the value from the 'wire e' is provided to the 'wire f'

* What is the signal prvided to "wire a"
