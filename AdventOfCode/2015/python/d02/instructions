# elves need more wrapping paper and has to submit an order to get more
- they will be given dimensions of the presents needing wrapping paper (l, w, h)
- each box is a perfect retangular prism
	- meaning to calculate surface area is (2*l*w + 2*w*h + 2*h*l)
	- adding a little extra paper (the area of the smallest side)

# Now we need to find how much ribbon of equal width to order...
- ribbon required is shortest distance around its sides plus its bow.
	- bow is equal to the cubic feet of volume of the present
