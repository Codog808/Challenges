Santa wants to convert a physical list into a digital copy.

# Given an input of string literals find teh number of characters of in-memory string.
	example:
	"" is 2 total characters but the genuine string contains 0 characters
	"a", 3 total characters and 1 string character
	"a\"a", 6 total characters but the string contains 3 characters as the escape (\) allows the following character or character code to exist as a string when it is normally reserved for some other piece of coding language.

	Santa only uses the following escape sequences
		\\
		\"
		\x (plus two hexadecimal characters)

# What is (the number of characters of code for string literals) - (the number of characters in-memory for the values of the strings) in the total given input?
