Delivering presents to an infinite two-dimensional grid of houses
Directions of delivery are a little messed up, how many houses receive at least one present?
 - '^' go one house north
 - 'v' go one house south
 - '<' go one house west
 - '>' go one house east
 - Starting at one house initally, count must start at 1 to concur.
